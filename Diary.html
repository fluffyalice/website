       <p>1rd December, 2019, Saturday</p>
       <p>Time:9:00 A.M.</p>
       <p>Dear diary,</p>
       <p>Today was a busy day. I decided to study at the top of the library today. First of all, since we did not book the group study room on the fourth floor, my team members and I decided to meet in the flexible space. The flexi space is a circular space in the center of the building, where about ten to fifteen irregular-shaped desks of various sizes are arranged for students to do group work. At flexi space, we can see the library downstairs through a transparent fence.</p>
       <p>
           By 12:00 P.M. After three hours, we finished the group discussion, and I decided to find a place suitable for studying alone on the fourth floor. The flex space has two exits, one faces north and one faces south. I went out through the north gate and came to silent study space, a room where there are many independent desks with lamps, and every four tables are in a group, and each group has two computers. There is also a white board above the desk for students to take notes. What a good place for independent study!
       </p>
       <p>By 4:00 P.M. When I finished my self-study and got ready to go home, I passed by the media booth. I found there were many media equipment, including microphones, tuners and computers. Each room is separate and soundproof. As I prepared to leave the penthouse, I found a large device for renting computers to students. There was a screen in the middle of the device. It seemed that students could rent computers by using student card.</p>
       <p>Love</p>
